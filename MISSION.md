# Goals

Code Labs has a number of goals:

- To create a space where committed individuals (especially University students) can be introduced to and collaborate with one another. CodeLabs seeks to provide a place for these like-minded individuals to work together and learn from one another whilst getting a chance to socialize.

- To assemble members with marketable skills to create public domain projects requiring expertise in multiple fields.

- Working with external companies to build a network of connections beneficial to CodeLabs and its members.

- Developing projects with members which display deep knowledge and experience innfields relevant to future employers.
